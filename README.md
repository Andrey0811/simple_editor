# Simple 3D Scene
## Program can: 
* read ASCII STL format file and very slowly for binary STL
* use triangles from a file to build a solid object and display it on a 3D scene
* you can view an item from all sides by rotating, zooming in or out

## How it works:
* you launch the main.py and can click the following (in table) buttons to open the object
* initially, the file that is written in the code opens 'Galleon.stl'

button       | function
-------------|--------------------------------------------------
  'e'        | open STL file in the app from Explorer 
 'right'     | turn the object in right
 'left'      | turn the object in left
 'up'        | turn the object in up
 'down'      | turn the object in down
  'o'        | approach of the object
  'p'        | distance of the object
  'w'| move the object in up
  'd'| move the object in right
  'a'| move the object in left
  's'| move the object in down
  mouse wheel| approach/distance of the object
  move mouse | turn object
  
  ## How it install:
