# Simple 3D Editor 
## Program can: 
* read ASCII STL format file
* use triangles from a file to build a solid object and display it on a 3D scene
* you can view an item from all sides by rotating, zooming in or out

## How it works:
* you launch the main.py and can click the following (in table) buttons to open the object
* initially, the file that is written in the code opens 'Galleon.stl'

button       | function
